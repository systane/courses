# Golang


Go was created in 2009, and it's an opensource project. The main reason for creating golang was to attend to the needs of Google. At the time, software engineers from Google had problems with C++, because it was extremely complex to program, and when you're resolving a problem with this language, there are many ways to do this, (you can have multiple solutions to the same problem). Maybe you're wondering, why do not change to Java? Java depends on a JVM, so the performance is extremely tightened to the virtual machine. Why do not use an interpreted language? Because compiled languages are more efficient than interpreted languages (optimized). Golang solves all of these problems:
-Golang has a faster time to execute and compile than C++;
-It does not depend on a virtual machine;
-It's simpler than other languages (just one way to write code);


Go it's not an object-oriented language programming, but it has some features from this paradigm (polymorphism and interface, for example). Another nice feature of golang is that it has "functions" as a first-order object, so you can store functions in variables, and pass them as parameters.
