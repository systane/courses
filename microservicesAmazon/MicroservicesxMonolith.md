### What are microservices?
Microservices is an architectural style where our application is composed of modules that can be independently developed and deployed.

### Why microservices?
With microservice, we can reduce the complexity of a large monolith into small services that work independent. Besides this, microservices also help us to parallel the development
effort to build an application with different programming languages and tecnologies. 

### What are the trade offs?
Microservices is not perfect, we this architectural style we need to worry more about the networking communication between our services and we need to put more effort in tracing
and debugging to be able to resolve a bug or to monitor the health of our application. We also need to spend a lot of time to set-up and manage our independente parts.

### What are the benefits?
In the second question we already covered some benefits of using microservices, but there is more! With microservices, we can scale only one part of our mesh of services, and this
helps us to reduce our costs. Think about it, what if we were trying to scale our monolith? We would need to spent a lot of money in a big mainframe.
