## Management

### Cloud Trail
It's a service that allow you to audit (or review) everything that occurs in your AWS account. Cloud Trail does this by recording all the AWS API calls occurring in your account
delivering a log file to you. With Cloud Trail we can: know who has logged in, services that were accessed, actions performed, parameters for the actions, responses returned. You
can set up alarms and notifications if suspicious access occurs.

### CloudFormation
This service allows you to model your entire infraestructure in a text file template allowing you to provision AWS resources based on the scripts you write. You can write these
templates using JSON or YAML.
